# Addressable-7-Segment-RGB-Display

*Addressable 7-segment RGB display using NodeMCU and WS2812b LEDs.*

This is a 7 segment display made using **WS2812b individually addressable LEDs**. This LEDs requires only one Data line to control tons on such LEDs connected in series like a daisy chain formation. Each digit display consist of **2 LEDs per segment**, so there is **14 LEDs in each display**. They are connected to one another by header pins. The *output of the first Display connected to the input of the second display* and so on. So you can use any numbers of displays as you want. And can show any digit on any display.
I have written a demo code to test the displays. It has several functions like 

- Looping through the segments
- Displaying all the numbers across the displays
- Counting up and Counting Down to a given number
- Some animations.
